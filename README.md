# Predicting Bike Sharing Data 

In this project, I built a simple neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset comes from UCI Machine Learning Database.

[Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)

The target of this project is to implement the components of a neural network including forward pass training, backpropagation, and an activation function to train data in order to be able to predict number of bikes to be shared.

## Neural Network Arcitecture

The network is very simple consisting of an input layer, output layer and just one hidden layer. 

## Hyperparameters

epochs = 2000
learning_rate = 1
hidden_nodes = 10
output_nodes = 1

## Training and Validation Losses

Training Loss < 0.07
Validation Loss < 0.14
