# Predicting Bike Sharing Data 

This project is a part of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

-- Project Status: Completed

## Project Introduction

Building a simple neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem
on the bike sharing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Database.

## Technologies

- Python3
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to implement the components of a neural network including forward pass training, backpropagation, and an activation function to predict number of bikes to be shared using [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset). 

The resulted training loss < 0.07 and validation loss < 0.14 that pass the required training loss (0.09) and validation loss (0.18). (for more details on network architecture and hyperpatameters see this [document](https://github.com/eng-dtarek/Bike_Sharing_Data_Prediction/blob/master/my_answers.py)).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)).
2. Install the above technologies
3. cd into the project-bikesharing directory.
4. Create a new conda environment >> conda create --name deep-learning python=3
5. Enter your new environment: Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning, Windows: >> activate deep-learning
6. Run the following to open up the notebook server >> jupyter notebook
